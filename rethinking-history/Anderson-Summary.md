Summary Rethinking History p. 6-32
*History and the past are two different things. The past was experienced while history is an incomplete retelling of the past.
  history is a discourse about the past
  history is work that is written or recorded about the past
  history is something that is read the past was experienced 
  kinda like the difference between primary and secondary sources?
  women were a part of the past but rarely come up in history
*Historical events can have many different interpretations.  Depending on the historian’s particular bent and other 
internal/external forces, their recounting of a particular event will differ from other historians looking at the same sources. 
  even the mechanism (history) used to “read” the event can change or have multiple faucets 
  basically the various schools of though in history i.e.. post modern, feminists, etc.
  history is composed of epistemology, methodology, and ideology
  forces include the professional nature of history and the pressure that comes from that professionalization 
    refer to p. 27
  history is subject to the writing process 
    refer to p.28
  interpretation of history is also subject to what the reader takes from the writing which will be different for each reader 
  and can be different for the same reader at different times 
*History’s ability to capture knowledge is limited due to the past-history distinction. The historian can only obtain a certain 
 amount of information regarding an event that has occurred in the past, which inevitably leaves history an incomplete version
 of the past.
  historians don’t think of themselves as fiction writers but may inadvertently become so in trying to connect history and the 
    past
  however this uncertainty in necessary for history to exist otherwise it would be pointless 
  various perceptions are the only way to check historians interpretation 
  history is inevitably influenced by the historian writing it
  history is just pieces of the past, incomplete
  however hindsight does allow in some way for history to be more complete i.e. advances in technology providing insight
*Choosing a method to study the past is in itself problematic because one must decide which method to use, which injects more 
 subjectivity into history.  
*History is ideological because of the external and internal forces operating on the historian regardless of if the historian 
 is a “black Marxist-feminist”.  Simply because a particular subject in history is common or popular does not remove the 
 ideology from the historian writing the history.
*History is more about who is writing it and who it is for rather then what it is.  
  people have been using history to legitimize their status/general life for years i.e. history isn’t strictly used for
  academic purposes
